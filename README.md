# CourseEvaluation
We would like to design a website where students can post their opinion about a teacher. This website should have following functions: 1.     Clients can sign up a new account 2.     Clients can post evaluation under courses they attended 3.     Clients can view other students’ evaluation



## Setup and run the application

### Setup and run the backend
The backend application is created based on Flask - a web service framework from Python ecosystem, so, a python environment need to be installed before run the application.
#### Setup Python and PIP
Just download Python from its official site and install it.
Also pip has already been packaged inside Python since latest version, it is better to install one from pip's official site if the OS is Mac OSX.

#### Setup dependencies
Run the following command to install all dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Start the backend
Run the following command to start the backend server:
```
python app.py
```


### Setup and run the frontend

Just open the index.html from a browser.

In case of changing something in the source codes, you can rebuild the html files with necessary JS files by the following steps:
1. Install NodeJS and Yarn
2. From the project folder run the following commands.
    ```
    yarn install
    grunt
    ```
